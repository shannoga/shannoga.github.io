One of the mos common mistakes that is preety easy to understand and fix is calling a property from it's own getter.

Let's say we have a string property called `name`  

{% highlight objective-c %}
@property (nonatomic, copy) NSString * name;
{% endhighlight %}

Since this is a persons name, every time we access this property we want to capitalize it, so we use the getter to do that -

{% highlight objective-c %}
- (NSString *)name
{
    NSString *capitalizedName = [self.name capitalizedString];
    return capitalizedName;
}
{% endhighlight %}

And lastly somewhere in our code we access the `name` property -

{% highlight objective-c %}
NSString *nameText = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello %@",self.name];
{% endhighlight %}

Runing the app will cause xCode to stuck for a few seconds and then we will crash.

**Why ?**

What we did is created an `infinite recursion` and caused a [Stack overflow][link-1], and simpler -

We just created a method that calls itself again and again and again and again.............and again...
As you can see calling  {% highlight objective-c %} [NSString stringWithFormat:@"Hello %@",self.name];{% endhighlight %} is 100% isentical to {% highlight objective-c %} [self.name capitalizedString]{% endhighlight %} that we used in the getter.

callig self.name tells the compiler to access the getter
