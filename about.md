Discovered programming late in my life, I started with [ActionScript3][actionscript-link] which I loved and will always remember as my first, real, programming language. Then the iPhone was born and like many others I was sure I am going to be a rich man, well, like many others I did not but I have learned a lot and discovered my love to coding. 

As a late-bloomer I have a lot to learn and in the way I am making mistakes, some stupid, some annoying and some from lake of knowledge. Not from all I have learned but all where the only way to learn. 

This Blog is a diary of my coding mistakes \(Mainly [Objective-C][objectivec-link] and soon [Swift][swift-link]) from the past and ones I will make in the future. I hope putting them on the screen will help me avoid them and might help others. I will not cal myself a new programmer but I have defiantly a lot more to learn, so if you find a mistake in my posts or want to contribute a mistake you made you are more then welcome. Happy coding!
