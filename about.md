Discovered programming late in my life, I started with [ActionScript3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) which I loved and will always remember as my first, real, programming language. Then the iPhone was born and like many others I was sure I am going to be a reach man, well, like many others I did not but I have learned a lot and discovered my love to coding. 

As a late-bloomer I have a lot to learn and in the way I am making mistakes, some stupid, some annoying and some from lake of knowledge. Not from all I have learned but all where the only way to learn. 

This Blog is a diary of my coding mistakes \(Mainly [Objective-C] (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) and soon [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)\) from the past and ones I will make in the future. I hope putting them on the screen will help me avoid them and might help others. I will not cal myself a new programmer but I have defiantly a lot more to learn, so if you find a mistake in my posts or want to contribute a mistake you made you are more then welcome. Happy coding!
